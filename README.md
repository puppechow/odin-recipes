INITIAL THOUGHT PROCESS:
Going into this, I want to do something fun and interesting. Expectations are low, as it is the very first project TOP assigns. I could make the most bare-bones webpage possible and it would be passible for this project. That's not what I want, though. I'm going to sit down and draft up some ideas before I put anything into code.

SELF-REFLECTION:
TBA.
