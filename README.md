INITIAL THOUGHT PROCESS:
Going into this, I wanted to do something fun and interesting in spite of my technical limitations. Considering my lack of CSS knowledge, I figured the most creative thing I could do with this project is to lean into the website's simplistic design.

SELF-REFLECTION:
All-in-all, I had a lot of fun constructing this website! Though simple and not very eye-catching, it has a surprising amount of character. The website itself wasn't difficult to create, but my greatest challenge was overcoming my creative limitations. I started The Odin Project after spending years messing around with building layouts using Bootstrap, so certain elements and tags I was accustomed to using simply weren't an option. I couldn't execute certain ideas that I had for the website, which is a shame, but I look forward to being able to revisit this project and give it a makeover!
